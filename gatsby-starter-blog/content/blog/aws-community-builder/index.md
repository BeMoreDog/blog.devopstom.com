A lot of my community of readers will already be aware that I'm a pretty big fan of AWS, so it was a real privilege and thrill to receive an email a few weeks ago stating that I'd been accepted into the [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) programme. 

For me, it's basically an opportunity to have more resources for writing about AWS services, an opportunity to connect with other builders around the world, and focus more on developing and sharing knowledge around Security and Identity. 

For you, the community of readers, this means there'll be more AWS-focused content over the next 12-18 months. 

I'm looking forward to learning new things, and sharing them with you all!
