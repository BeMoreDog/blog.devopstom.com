I recently acquired some ceramic tiles, and after a good bit of cleaning, they're all presentable and nice.  There's 30 in total.

Problem is, I'd like to know what the pattern is, who the designer/manufacturer was, and also, do they have any value.

Some friends and family have suggested that they: "Look over 50 years old", "Look like a morris pattern", "look handmade", "look valuable", "mediaevally beautiful", "worth finding out about".
