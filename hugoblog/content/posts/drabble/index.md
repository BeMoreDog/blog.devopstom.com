I wonder if you’ve heard of a Drabble?

A drabble, simply put, is a story, normally science fiction or fantasy that is exactly one hundred (100) words in length. No more, no less.

Here is mine:

> It was a slow day in the spaceport.  
> “These rocket cowlings aren’t going to fix themselves”, Simon thought to himself, wistfully. 

> It was 4 days since the incident, nobody said a word after it happened, not until this morning, that is. 

> Simon knew exactly what to do; he lifted the great copper mallet above his head, and struck the cowling with all his might. 

> The resonance shook the entire rocket, the mallet, his arm and the rest of his body. “Damnit”, Simon swore, just as a shadow appeared over Simon’s left shoulder. 
> “I owe you a pint, for this”, the shadow said.
