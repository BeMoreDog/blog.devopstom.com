description: "NPM Dependency Hell, trying to upgrade Gatsby"
---

Until recently, this blog was hosted on GatsbyCloud -- Which was recently discontinued :sadpanda:

In theory, it should've been reasonably easy to just host Gatsby myself, and carry on, but really I thought I should upgrade to the latest version..
But that got me into NPM Dependency Hell, and frankly my dears, I don't have time for that kind of nonsense. 

So I'm reworking it all to be generated by Hugo, then it's just static, and I can stick it somewhere like S3 and call it a day.
